1% Carrageenan

Potasium: 30 mM K . Carrageenan 3,4,5 (Same gel, different images)
Sodium: 300 mM Na

Protocol:

pixel size of 1x binned: 0.86nm
2x binned: 1.72nm

Reconstructions:
K_Carrageenan 4:
Area: 1881x1881 pixel image(1xBinned) = 1671 x 1671 nm^2
	Volume: x95 slices = 1671 x 1671 x 81 nm^3

K_Carrageenan 3:
Area: 960 x 960 pixel (2xBinned) = 1651.2 x 1651.2 nm^2
	Volume: x110 slices = 1651.2 x 1651.2 x 189.2 nm^3


From Andrew: 
All gel tomograms have been taken at nominal magnification 12,000X, and images with pixel dimensions between 1024 x1024 and2048x2048 are full resolution, so pixel size = 0.86 nm. I would have to go through them individually because there is always some clipping of areas during reconstruction to minimise the required disk space.

Anything more than 512x512 but less than 1024x1024 will be 2x binned, so double the pixel size, etc..

When it comes to 2D images â€“ hard to say what mag. Often they contain header information, so if you open them in ImageJ, the dimensions might be shown above the image. But as I said, just let me know which ones.
